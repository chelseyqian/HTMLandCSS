    <h1>Deleting from a Red-Black Tree</h1>
    <h2>We divide the situations into three types:</h2>
    <ul id="types">
        <li>Deleted node is red</li>
        <li>Deleted node is black and replacement is red</li>
        <li>Deleted node is black and without red replacement</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Deleted node is red</h3>
    <p>If deleted node is red, no additional steps needed.</p>
    <h3>Deleted node is black and replacement is red</h3>
    <p>If deleted node is black and replacement is red, turn replacement black.</p>
    <h3>Deleted node is black and without red replacement</h3>
